# Docker Captains and Our Projects

Docker Captain is a distinction that Docker awards select members of the community that are both experts 
in our field and are passionate about sharing our Docker knowledge with others. We Captains are Docker 
ambassadors (not employees), and volunteer our time to create Docker related projects, blogs, meetups, 
books, workshops, tutorials, and conference sessions around the world.

We are eager to bring our various fields of expertise to new audiences both offline and online 
around the world - donâ€™t hesitate to reach out us via the social links below!
